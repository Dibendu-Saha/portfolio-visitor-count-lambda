# About

This repository is part of the **AWS Cloud Resume Challenge** -
https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/

On every visit to my portfolio website, an API endpoint is triggered to an <ins>AWS Lambda</ins> via the <ins>AWS API Gateway</ins> that updates and retrieves the total visitor count from an <ins>Amazon DynamoDB</ins> table.
